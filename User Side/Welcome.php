		<h2>An important Message to all the parents : </h2><hr>
		Many parents are concerned when their children are not practicing letters 
		and numbers, they feel that completing paper and pencil exercises will most 
		effectively prepare their children for elementary school. To change this common idea
		in our society we are working in our nursery hand in hand with parents in order to 
		enrich your child's physical and mental development through our "Fun and Learn" strategy,
		where the child can enjoy learning through playing by using different activities.
		Our concept is aiming to increase the child's self confidence, encourage him to think
		widely and independently & work using his/her  own hands to prepare him to do pencil & paper
		work, a step that should come at some stage of preschool education without stressing over it.
